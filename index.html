    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p><img src="nicepicofme.jpg" alt="Picture of Me" style="float:left;width:200px;height:400px;">
        Hello! My name is Jacob Miller, and I have created this website as a demonstration of the basic skills of website development. I have experience from all over the world, having travelled to Spain, France, and Italy as a student ambassador, representing my country and in other areas of the world. This provided me with valuabale experience and gave me a better insight into not only my own homeland, but also that of other areas of the world. While overseas, I met with interesting people who encouraged me on my journey into software engineering, and has allowed me to view the world in an entirely new and different perspective.
        I have been entertaining myself with computers since I was able to operate them, and over the years I have learned how to use multiple softwares and even build my own PC from spare parts. I have been mostly interested in the hardware side of things, but recently have been learning much more that goes into the process of designing and presenting the information on these computing devices. As of now, I am learning as I go, and everyday I learn something new and useful towards my development skills. The field of software engineering is a widely variable and creative atmosphere, allowing the designer more ways to create their own unique designs and revolutionary concepts like never before. </p>
